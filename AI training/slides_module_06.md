## Slide 1: Module Title

**AI for Research — Discovery and Analysis**

- Research question formulation and refinement
- Literature review and paper summarization
- Research methodology design and data analysis
- Hands-on: Research workflow simulation

> Speaker notes: This module shifts from teaching to research applications. Many participants identified research efficiency as their top training goal.

---

## Slide 2: Lesson 1 — Research Question Formulation

**The refinement journey:**

Broad interest → Narrowed topic → Draft question → Refined question

**AI accelerates the middle stages:**
- Generating research angles you might not have considered
- Helping evaluate specificity and feasibility
- Suggesting how to narrow broad interests

> Speaker notes: Most researchers spend weeks narrowing their topic. AI can compress this into hours — though human judgment remains essential for the final decision.

---

## Slide 3: The FINER Framework

**Evaluate research questions against these criteria:**

| Criterion | Question |
|-----------|---------|
| **F**easible | Can I actually conduct this study with available resources? |
| **I**nteresting | Does it matter to my field and audience? |
| **N**ovel | Does it contribute something new? |
| **E**thical | Can it be conducted ethically? |
| **R**elevant | Does it address a real problem or gap? |

> **Ask AI to evaluate your question against FINER criteria.**

> Speaker notes: FINER is a standard research quality framework. Using it with AI provides structured evaluation of question quality.

---

## Slide 4: Research Question Prompt Example

> You are a senior research advisor in Accounting and Finance. I am interested in studying the impact of AI adoption on accounting practices.
>
> 1. Suggest 5 specific research angles within this area
> 2. For each, propose a draft research question
> 3. Rate each on novelty (low/medium/high) and feasibility (low/medium/high)
> 4. Recommend the 2 most promising for a Nigerian university PhD study
>
> Constraints: Access to accounting firms and faculty in North-Central Nigeria, 3-year timeline, limited funding.

> Speaker notes: Walk through this example. Emphasize how practical constraints (location, timeline, funding) dramatically affect which questions are feasible.

---

## Slide 5: Iterative Question Refinement

**Round 1:** Brainstorm broadly from your interest
**Round 2:** Narrow top candidates (specify population, variables, context)
**Round 3:** Evaluate against FINER criteria
**Round 4:** Test by asking: "What methodology would this question require?"

> **If the required methodology seems impractical, refine further.**

**Example follow-up prompt:**
> "This question is too broad. Identify what makes it broad and suggest 3 more specific versions."

> Speaker notes: Demonstrate the iterative process. Research question development is never a single step — even with AI assistance.

---

## Slide 6: Important Warning

**AI may suggest research questions for topics that have already been extensively studied.**

**Always verify:**
- Has this exact question been answered before?
- Is the claimed "gap" real?
- Check Google Scholar, not just AI, for existing research

> **AI generates plausible suggestions. YOU verify their novelty through actual literature searching.**

> Speaker notes: This is critical. AI cannot reliably identify genuine research gaps because it doesn't have access to all published research.

---

## Slide 7: Lesson 2 — Literature Review with AI

**What AI CAN do:**
- Summarize papers in structured format
- Extract themes across multiple papers
- Suggest organizational structures
- Create synthesis tables

**What AI CANNOT reliably do:**
- Cite real, existing papers (hallucination risk!)
- Access papers after its training cutoff
- Replace deep reading of original sources

> **Golden rule: Never cite a source based on AI's description alone.**

> Speaker notes: This is the highest-risk area for AI hallucinations. Reinforce this golden rule repeatedly.

---

## Slide 8: Structured Paper Summary Template

> Summarize this paper using this exact structure:
>
> **Citation:** [to be verified by me]
> **Research Question:** What question did the study address?
> **Methodology:** Research design and methods (2-3 sentences)
> **Sample:** Who/what was studied, size, context
> **Key Findings:** Main results (3-5 bullet points)
> **Limitations:** Limitations noted by the authors
> **Relevance:** How this relates to [MY TOPIC]

> **Use this template consistently across all papers for easy comparison.**

> Speaker notes: Provide this as a handout. Consistent structure makes it easy to build synthesis tables and identify patterns across papers.

---

## Slide 9: Safe Literature Review Strategy

**Use AI for STRUCTURE, not CONTENT:**

| DO | DON'T |
|----|-------|
| Ask AI to suggest themes for organizing your review | Ask AI to write your literature review |
| Use AI to outline the structure | Trust AI-generated citations |
| Ask AI to identify connections between themes | Copy AI summaries into your paper |
| Use research tools (Elicit, Consensus) for discovery | Rely solely on AI for paper finding |

> Speaker notes: The safest approach is using AI for organizational help while doing the actual reading and writing yourself.

---

## Slide 10: Research-Specific Tools for Literature

| Tool | What It Does | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Elicit** | Finds papers via natural language questions | Paper discovery |
| **Consensus** | Shows research consensus with evidence | Evidence synthesis |
| **SciSpace** | Explains complex papers simply | Understanding papers |
| **Semantic Scholar** | Citation networks and influence analysis | Finding seminal papers |
| **Google Scholar** | Comprehensive academic search | Verification |

> **Workflow:** Elicit/Consensus (find) → General AI (organize) → Google Scholar (verify)

> Speaker notes: If time allows, do a live demo of Elicit or Consensus. Show how they provide actual sourced results — unlike general AI.

---

## Slide 11: Lesson 3 — Methodology Design

**AI can help with:**
- Suggesting appropriate research designs
- Comparing methodology options with pros/cons
- Designing data collection instruments
- Recommending analysis techniques
- Identifying potential weaknesses

**AI should NOT make final decisions.** You understand your context, field conventions, and resources better than AI.

> Speaker notes: Methodology is where AI serves as advisor, not decision-maker. The final methodology must reflect your expert judgment.

---

## Slide 12: Methodology Prompt Example

> You are a senior research methodologist. My research question: "What factors influence accounting lecturers' intention to adopt AI tools in Nigerian universities?"
>
> Compare three approaches:
> 1. Quantitative (survey)
> 2. Qualitative (interviews)
> 3. Mixed methods
>
> For each: (a) suitability for my question, (b) sample size needs, (c) analysis methods, (d) time and resources, (e) publication likelihood.
>
> Recommend one considering: access to 5 universities, 2-year timeline.

> Speaker notes: This prompt produces a structured comparison that helps researchers make informed decisions. It mirrors what a good supervisor would discuss.

---

## Slide 13: Survey Instrument Design Example

> Design a 30-item questionnaire on accounting lecturers' AI tool adoption:
>
> Sections: Demographics (5 items), AI familiarity (5 items), Current usage (5 items), Perceived benefits (5 items), Barriers (5 items), Adoption intention (5 items).
>
> Use Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) as framework. Likert scale 1-5. Each item: clear, concise, single construct. Provide anchor labels.
>
> Also suggest 3 open-ended questions for qualitative insights.

> Speaker notes: Point out how specifying the theoretical framework (TAM) guides the AI to generate items aligned with established constructs.

---

## Slide 14: Activity — Research Workflow Simulation

**Objective:** Simulate the early-stage research workflow using AI

**What you'll do:**
1. Start with a broad research interest from your field
2. Use AI to formulate a specific research question (show refinement)
3. Generate a literature review outline (themes, not content)
4. Get a methodology recommendation
5. Compile into a one-page research plan

**Time:** 45 minutes

> Speaker notes: This is the most comprehensive research activity. Guide participants to choose topics they're genuinely interested in for maximum relevance.

---

## Slide 15: Activity Debrief

**Discussion:**

1. At which stage was AI most helpful? Where did you still need your own expertise?
2. Did AI suggest research angles you hadn't considered?
3. How would you verify AI's claims about research gaps?
4. How will you integrate AI into your actual research planning?

> Speaker notes: Key insight: AI is most helpful at brainstorming and structuring, less helpful at verifying novelty and making final methodology decisions.

---
