## Slide 2: What is Prompt Engineering?

**The skill of crafting effective instructions for AI tools to get the best possible output**

It is the difference between:
- Getting a vague, generic answer
- Getting a precisely targeted, high-quality response that saves hours

> **Think of it like asking questions in a seminar.** A vague question gets a rambling answer. A precise question gets a focused, useful answer.

> Speaker notes: Use the seminar analogy. Most participants have experienced the difference between good and bad questions in class discussions. The same principle applies to AI.

---

## Slide 3: Why the Same Question Gets Different Answers

**Vague prompt:** "Tell me about research methods"
**Result:** Broad, textbook-style overview. Not useful for any specific task.

**Specific prompt:** "Compare structured interviews versus questionnaires for collecting data on faculty AI perceptions in Nigerian universities. Consider time, cost, and respondent access."
**Result:** Focused, actionable comparison directly relevant to your context.

> **The information inside the AI is the same. Your prompt quality determines the output quality.**

> Speaker notes: If possible, demonstrate this live. Type both prompts into ChatGPT and show the difference in real time. This is the most convincing way to show prompt engineering's value.

---

## Slide 4: The ROI of Good Prompting

| Without Prompt Engineering | With Prompt Engineering |
|---------------------------|----------------------|
| Generic output needs heavy editing | Targeted output needs minimal editing |
| Multiple attempts to get something usable | First response is close to what you need |
| Time wasted on reformatting | Output arrives in your preferred format |
| Miss important aspects | All components addressed |

> **Investing 2-3 extra minutes in your prompt saves 20-30 minutes of editing.**

> Speaker notes: Make the time-saving argument concrete. For busy academics, this is the most compelling benefit.

---

## Slide 5: The 5-Component Framework

**Every powerful prompt uses some combination of these five building blocks:**

1. **Role** — Who should the AI be?
2. **Context** — What background does the AI need?
3. **Task** — What exactly should the AI do?
4. **Format** — How should the output be structured?
5. **Constraints** — What boundaries or requirements apply?

> You don't always need all five, but using more components almost always improves quality.

> Speaker notes: This is THE framework for the entire training. Write it on a whiteboard/flipchart and keep it visible throughout the rest of the training. Participants will reference it constantly.

---

## Slide 6: Component 1 — Role

**Tell the AI what expertise or perspective to adopt**

**Effective academic roles:**
- "You are an experienced accounting professor at a research university"
- "You are a peer reviewer for a top-tier education journal"
- "You are a Socratic tutor who guides through questions, not answers"
- "You are a research methodology expert specializing in mixed-methods"

> **The more specific the role, the better the output.**
> "You are an expert" < "You are a senior research methodologist specializing in survey design for social science research"

> Speaker notes: Demonstrate the impact of roles. Show the same prompt with and without a role. The difference is usually dramatic.

---

## Slide 7: Component 2 — Context

**Provide background information the AI needs for a relevant response**

**Context includes:**
- Who the audience is (undergraduates, journal reviewers, grant committee)
- What field or subject area
- What you've already done or know
- Relevant constraints or circumstances

**Example:**
> "I teach introductory accounting to 200 first-year students, many with no business background. The course follows the ICAN syllabus."

> Speaker notes: Context is often the most impactful addition. Without it, AI guesses — and often guesses wrong about your audience, field, and situation.

---

## Slide 8: Component 3 — Task

**State precisely what you want the AI to do**

| Weak Tasks | Strong Tasks |
|-----------|-------------|
| "Help me with my course" | "Create a rubric for evaluating research proposals" |
| "Tell me about research" | "Generate 10 MCQs on depreciation methods" |
| "Write something about AI" | "Draft a 250-word abstract for my study on..." |

> **Use specific action verbs:** Create, Analyze, Compare, Design, Evaluate, Generate, Suggest

> Speaker notes: Task specificity is where many beginners struggle most. They describe what they want to talk about rather than what they want the AI to do.

---

## Slide 9: Component 4 — Format

**Tell the AI how to structure its response**

**Format options:**
- Bullet points or numbered lists
- Table with specific columns
- Structured outline with headings
- Paragraph with word count
- Step-by-step procedure
- Comparison matrix

> **Without format specification, the AI chooses its own — which may not suit your needs.**

> Speaker notes: Format saves editing time. If you want a table, ask for a table. If you want bullet points, say so. This seems obvious but most beginners forget it.

---

## Slide 10: Component 5 — Constraints

**Set boundaries, requirements, or limitations**

**Examples:**
- **Word count:** "Keep under 500 words"
- **Difficulty:** "Suitable for students with no prior accounting knowledge"
- **Exclusions:** "Do not include mathematical formulas"
- **Requirements:** "Include real-world examples from African contexts"
- **Tone:** "Use formal academic language"

> Speaker notes: Constraints are the fine-tuning component. They prevent the AI from going off in unwanted directions.

---

## Slide 11: The Master Template

**Putting all 5 components together:**

> **[Role]** You are [specific expertise].
>
> **[Context]** [Background information about audience, situation, or purpose].
>
> **[Task]** [Specific, actionable instruction].
>
> **[Format]** Format your response as [specific structure].
>
> **[Constraints]** [Any limitations, requirements, or boundaries].

> Speaker notes: Display this template prominently. Participants should write it down or photograph it. They will use it for every activity going forward.

---

## Slide 12: Complete Example — Teaching

> **Role:** You are an experienced Financial Accounting professor with expertise in active learning.
>
> **Context:** I teach second-year undergraduates (80 students). Next class covers Revenue Recognition under IFRS 15. Students have completed introductory accounting.
>
> **Task:** Create a 90-minute lesson plan using active learning strategies. Include learning objectives, activities, and assessment.
>
> **Format:** Table with columns: Time, Activity, Description, Materials Needed.
>
> **Constraints:** Include at least one group activity, one case study, and one formative assessment. Activities must work without laptops.

> Speaker notes: Walk through each component. Point out how every component adds specificity. Ask: "What would happen if we removed the role? The context? The format?"

---

## Slide 13: Complete Example — Research

> **Role:** You are a senior research supervisor with expertise in qualitative methodology.
>
> **Context:** I am a PhD student in Education researching how lecturers perceive AI tools. I plan semi-structured interviews with 20 lecturers across 5 departments.
>
> **Task:** Develop an interview protocol with 12-15 questions exploring perceptions, usage, barriers, and training needs.
>
> **Format:** Questions organized by theme (4 themes), with main questions and follow-up probes.
>
> **Constraints:** Open-ended, non-leading questions. Appropriate for 45-minute interviews. No technical jargon.

> Speaker notes: This example resonates directly with participants' research work. Point out how the constraints prevent common interview design mistakes.

---

## Slide 14: Lesson 3 — From Vague to Precise

**Five real transformations showing weak → strong prompts**

The pattern is always the same:
1. Identify what is vague or missing
2. Add **Role** (expertise and perspective)
3. Add **Context** (specific situation)
4. Make the **Task** specific and actionable
5. Specify **Format** and **Constraints**

> Speaker notes: This lesson is case-study based. Walk through each transformation step by step. Ask participants to identify what's missing before you reveal the improved version.

---

## Slide 15: Transformation 1 — Lesson Planning

**Weak:** "Make a lesson plan for accounting."

**What's missing:** Role, topic, level, duration, format, constraints — everything.

**Strong:**
> You are an accounting professor who uses active learning. Create a 2-hour plan on "Double-Entry Bookkeeping" for first-year students with no accounting knowledge. Include: 3 objectives, motivational opener, 20-minute content segments, group activity, formative assessment. Table format. Simple language.

> Speaker notes: This is the most relatable transformation for participants who teach. Have them practice: "What components would YOU add?"

---

## Slide 16: Transformation 2 — Literature Review

**Weak:** "Help with my literature review."

**Strong:**
> You are a research supervisor in social science. I am writing a literature review on "Digital Financial Services and Financial Inclusion in Sub-Saharan Africa." I have 20 papers but struggle to organize them.
>
> Suggest 5 thematic categories. For each: (a) what it covers, (b) key debates to highlight, (c) how it connects to the broader topic. Present as separate sections with headings.

**Impact:** Customized organizational framework vs. generic advice.

> Speaker notes: Point out that the strong prompt specifies the exact problem (organizing, not writing) and the desired output (thematic categories, not a draft).

---

## Slide 17: Transformation 3 — Manuscript Feedback

**Weak:** "Review my paper."

**Strong:**
> You are a peer reviewer for an accounting journal. Read my introduction on "AI Adoption in Auditing Firms." Provide feedback on:
> 1. Clarity of research problem
> 2. Quality of literature integration
> 3. Whether the gap is identified
> 4. Strength of stated contribution
>
> For each: specific comments + suggestions. Constructively critical tone.

**Impact:** Structured, journal-quality feedback vs. vague comments.

> Speaker notes: Researchers in the audience will immediately see the value. This prompt mirrors what a good peer reviewer actually does.

---

## Slide 18: Transformation 4 — Quiz Creation

**Weak:** "Create a quiz for my class."

**Strong:**
> You are an assessment expert. Create a formative quiz for 2nd-year Business Ethics students on "Corporate Social Responsibility."
>
> Include: 5 MCQs (recall + comprehension) and 3 short-answer (application + analysis). MCQs: question, 4 options, correct answer, explanation. Short-answer: question, model answer, grading criteria.
>
> Cover: CSR theories, real-world examples, ethical dilemmas.

**Impact:** Complete, balanced assessment with answer keys.

> Speaker notes: Ask: "How long would it take to create this quiz manually vs. with this prompt?" The time savings are dramatic.

---

## Slide 19: The Transformation Pattern

**Every transformation follows the same 6 steps:**

1. Identify what's vague or missing in the original
2. Add a **Role** to set expertise
3. Provide **Context** specific to your situation
4. Make the **Task** specific and actionable
5. Specify the **Format** you need
6. Add **Constraints** to control quality

> **Practice this pattern and it becomes automatic.**

> Speaker notes: Reinforce this pattern. It will be applied in every activity for the rest of the training.

---

## Slide 20: Activity — Prompt Transformation Workshop

**Objective:** Practice the 5-component framework on real prompts

**What you'll do:**
1. Select 3 weak prompts (provided or your own)
2. Identify missing components in each
3. Rewrite using all 5 components
4. Test BOTH versions in an AI tool
5. Compare and document the difference

**Time:** 50 minutes

> Speaker notes: This is the most important activity of the training. Ensure every participant completes at least 2 transformations. Circulate and help those who struggle with specificity.

---

## Slide 21: Weak Prompts to Transform

**Choose three:**

- A: "Explain supply and demand"
- B: "Help with my research on student motivation"
- C: "Create a quiz for my class"
- D: "Write an introduction for my paper"
- E: "Suggest teaching activities"

**Or create your own** based on tasks you actually need.

**Template for improvement:**
> Role → Context → Task → Format → Constraints

> Speaker notes: Encourage participants to use their own weak prompts from real work. This makes the exercise immediately applicable.

---

## Slide 22: Activity Debrief

**Discussion Questions:**

1. Which of the 5 components had the biggest impact on improving responses?
2. How will you apply this framework in your daily work?
3. Did any improved prompts still produce unsatisfactory responses? What would you change?
4. How long did it take to write a good prompt vs. editing a poor AI response?

> Speaker notes: Most participants will say Context or Role had the biggest impact. Reinforce that investing time in the prompt saves much more time in editing.

---
