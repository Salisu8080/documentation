## Slide 1: Module Title

**AI for Teaching — Student Engagement and Feedback**

- Simplifying complex concepts for different levels
- Creating interactive activities and case studies
- Providing feedback on student work at scale
- Hands-on: Create differentiated learning resources

> Speaker notes: This module focuses on the student-facing side of teaching — making content accessible, engaging, and supported by quality feedback.

## Slide 2: The Ladder of Abstraction

**Effective teaching moves students up the ladder:**

- **Level 1:** Everyday analogy (relatable, no jargon)
- **Level 2:** Simple definition (basic terminology, examples)
- **Level 3:** Technical definition (proper vocabulary, explained)
- **Level 4:** Advanced analysis (nuances, exceptions, connections)

> **AI can generate explanations at every rung.** The key is specifying which level you need.

> Speaker notes: This is a fundamental pedagogical concept. AI helps you create content at multiple levels simultaneously — something that takes hours manually.

---

## Slide 3: Multi-Level Explanation Example

> Explain "accrual accounting" at three levels:
>
> **Level 1** (Complete beginner): Everyday analogy. No jargon. Max 100 words.
>
> **Level 2** (First-year student): Basic terminology with definitions. Simple example. Max 150 words.
>
> **Level 3** (Third-year student): Full technical vocabulary, matching principle, revenue recognition, contrast with cash basis. Max 200 words.
>
> Start each level with a relatable scenario.

> Speaker notes: This single prompt produces content for three different audiences. Demonstrate live to show how useful and time-saving this is.

---

## Slide 4: The "ELI5" Technique

**"Explain Like I'm 5"**

> Explain [CONCEPT] as if talking to someone with no background. Use only everyday language, a real-world comparison, and no jargon. Then gradually increase complexity to academic level in three steps.

**Result:** Natural progression from simple to complex, mirroring good pedagogy.

**Key constraint to add:** "If you must use a technical term, define it immediately in parentheses."

> Speaker notes: ELI5 is a well-known technique online. Academics can adapt it by specifying the progression from simple to academic level.

---

## Slide 5: Context-Specific Analogies

**Generic analogies may not resonate with your students.**

> I teach research methodology to Nigerian postgraduate students who struggle with "statistical significance" vs. "practical significance."
>
> Create three analogies using scenarios Nigerian students would find relatable. Each should highlight why a statistically significant finding might not be practically important.

**Key tip:** Always specify your students' context — country, level, background.

> Speaker notes: AI defaults to Western-centric examples. Explicitly requesting Nigerian/African context produces more relatable content.

---

## Slide 6: Creating Interactive Activities

**Types AI can help create:**

1. **Case studies** — Realistic scenarios with analysis questions
2. **Discussion prompts** — Questions that generate genuine debate
3. **Problem sets** — Structured problems with progressive difficulty
4. **Role-play scenarios** — Professional situations for practice
5. **Think-pair-share** — Structured collaboration exercises

> Speaker notes: Move beyond lectures. AI is excellent at generating diverse activity types. The key is specifying the format, context, and learning objective.

---

## Slide 7: Case Study Generation Example

> Create a case study for 3rd-year Auditing students on "Internal Control Weaknesses."
>
> The case should:
> - Describe a fictional mid-sized Nigerian manufacturing company
> - Embed 4-5 internal control weaknesses (some obvious, some subtle)
> - Include financial context (revenue, employees)
> - End with 3 analysis questions: (a) identify weaknesses, (b) explain risks, (c) recommend improvements
>
> Length: 400-500 words. Difficulty: intermediate.

> Speaker notes: Point out the difficulty specification — "some obvious, some subtle." This creates differentiation within a single activity.

---

## Slide 8: Scaffolded Activity Design

**Ask AI to create progressively complex activities:**

> Create 3 activities on "Financial Statement Analysis" that increase in complexity:
>
> **Activity 1** (Warm-up): Identify basic ratios from a balance sheet (individual, 10 min)
> **Activity 2** (Application): Calculate and interpret 5 ratios for a company (pairs, 20 min)
> **Activity 3** (Analysis): Compare two companies using ratios and recommend the better investment (groups, 25 min)
>
> For each: instructions, data needed, expected outputs, debrief plan.

> Speaker notes: Scaffolding is a proven pedagogical strategy. AI can create the entire progression in one prompt, saving significant planning time.

## Slide 9: Using AI for Student Feedback

**AI CAN help with:**
- Generating structured, constructive comments
- Identifying common errors and suggesting corrections
- Maintaining consistent tone across submissions
- Drafting feedback aligned with rubric criteria

**AI CANNOT replace:**
- Your expert judgment on content accuracy
- Your knowledge of individual students
- The motivational impact of personal feedback
- Verification of field-specific claims

> Speaker notes: This is a sensitive topic. Some participants may feel AI feedback undermines the teacher-student relationship. Emphasize the "draft, then personalize" approach.

---

## Slide 10: Feedback Prompt Example

> You are a supportive but rigorous academic writing coach. Provide feedback on this student essay excerpt on "The Role of CSR in Modern Business."
>
> Evaluate: (1) thesis clarity, (2) evidence use, (3) argumentation, (4) writing quality.
>
> For each area: (a) what the student did well, (b) areas for improvement, (c) one concrete revision suggestion.
>
> Tone: encouraging but honest.
>
> [paste excerpt]

> Speaker notes: The "what's done well" requirement ensures feedback isn't purely negative. The "concrete revision suggestion" makes it actionable.

## Slide 11: Tiered Feedback Approach

| Assignment Stakes | AI Role | Your Role |
|------------------|---------|-----------|
| Low (weekly exercises) | AI generates feedback, you review quickly | Quick scan and approval |
| Medium (essays, problem sets) | AI drafts feedback, you edit and personalize | Add personal comments, verify accuracy |
| High (research proposals, finals) | AI helps organize your thoughts | Write the primary feedback yourself |

> **Always add personal touches that show you engaged with the student's specific work.**

> Speaker notes: This framework helps participants decide when and how much AI assistance is appropriate. The key is matching AI involvement to assignment importance.

---

## Slide 12: Ethical Considerations for AI Feedback

- **Transparency:** Should you tell students AI helped generate feedback?
- **Equity:** Is feedback quality consistent across students?
- **Accuracy:** AI may misidentify errors in specialized fields
- **Personal connection:** Students value knowing their teacher read their work

> **Best practice:** Disclose AI assistance. Add personal comments. Always review before sending.

> Speaker notes: Encourage an open discussion. Many institutions are still developing policies on this. The trend is toward transparency.

---

## Slide 13: Activity — Differentiated Learning Resource

**Objective:** Create multi-level content for one concept from your teaching area

**What you'll produce:**
1. Three explanations at different complexity levels
2. One real-world case study applying the concept
3. Discussion questions for the case study

**Then evaluate:** Is the Level 1 truly accessible? Is the case study accurate?

**Time:** 45 minutes

> Speaker notes: Guide topic selection. Good choices are concepts students commonly struggle with. Encourage participants from different fields to share their topics.

---

## Slide 14: Activity Debrief

**Discussion:**

1. How could you use multi-level explanations in your teaching?
2. Did AI create locally relevant examples, or did you need to specify Nigerian context?
3. How could differentiated resources address varying student abilities?
4. What other concepts would benefit from this approach?

> Speaker notes: Collect examples of good outputs to share. Discuss how multi-level content can be used for mixed-ability classes, study guides, or remedial support.
