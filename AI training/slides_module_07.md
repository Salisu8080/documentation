# Module 7: AI for Academic Writing
**Estimated Time:** 3.0 hours | **XP Reward:** 750

---

## Slide 1: Module Title

**AI for Academic Writing**

- Drafting and refining manuscript sections (IMRAD)
- Writing abstracts, cover letters, and grant proposals
- Responding to peer reviewer comments
- Hands-on: Academic writing exercise

> Speaker notes: Academic writing is where many researchers spend the most time. AI can dramatically accelerate the process while maintaining your scholarly voice.

## Slide 2: AI as Writing Assistant, NOT Author

**The critical distinction:**

| AI as Author (Problematic) | AI as Assistant (Acceptable) |
|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| Generate text and submit as your own | Brainstorm outlines and structures |
| Let AI do the thinking | Use AI to improve clarity |
| No human editing or judgment | Suggest phrasing options |
| No disclosure | Disclose AI assistance |

> **Most journals accept AI for editing, grammar, and clarity — with disclosure.**

> Speaker notes: Establish the ethical boundary clearly before teaching the techniques. This prevents misuse.

---

## Slide 3: The Iterative Writing Workflow

**The recommended process:**

1. **You draft** initial content from your research
2. **AI reviews** for structure, clarity, completeness
3. **You revise** based on AI suggestions (apply expertise)
4. **AI polishes** grammar, flow, consistency
5. **You finalize** with expert judgment

> **You are always the author. AI assists. You decide.**

> Speaker notes: Emphasize the cycle. The key is that YOU start with the content. AI helps you improve what you've already written.

---

## Slide 4: Lesson 1 — Manuscript Sections

**Use AI differently for each IMRAD section:**

| Section | AI Role |
|---------|---------|
| **Introduction** | Outline structure, suggest opening angles, identify gap framing |
| **Methods** | Check completeness, identify missing details |
| **Results** | Improve clarity of findings presentation |
| **Discussion** | Strengthen argument connections, suggest comparisons |

> Speaker notes: Different sections benefit from different types of AI assistance. Walk through each briefly.

---

## Slide 5: Introduction Assistance

> You are an academic writing coach. I'm writing the introduction for a paper on "Factors Influencing AI Adoption Among Accounting Lecturers in Nigerian Universities."
>
> Help me outline the introduction:
> 1. Opening paragraph: What broad context should I establish?
> 2. Literature context: Key themes to summarize?
> 3. Research gap: How to frame what's missing?
> 4. Purpose: How to state my contribution?
>
> Do NOT write the introduction. Provide an outline with guidance.

**Key:** Ask for OUTLINE, not finished text. You remain the author.

> Speaker notes: The "do NOT write" instruction is crucial. It keeps the participant as author while getting structural guidance.

---

## Slide 6: Methods Completeness Check

> You are a peer reviewer checking a methodology section. Evaluate whether my methods adequately address:
> 1. Research design justification
> 2. Population and sampling strategy
> 3. Instrument validity and reliability
> 4. Data analysis techniques
> 5. Ethical considerations
>
> For any weak area, suggest what to add. Do NOT rewrite — just identify gaps.
>
> [paste your methods draft]

> Speaker notes: This prompt uses AI as a critical reviewer, not a writer. It identifies what's missing so the researcher can add it themselves.

## Slide 7: Lesson 2 — Abstracts, Cover Letters, Grant Proposals

**Each document has specific conventions and high stakes:**

| Document | Audience | What Matters Most |
|----------|----------|------------------|
| Abstract | Readers deciding whether to read your paper | Clarity, completeness, impact |
| Cover letter | Editor deciding whether to review | Fit, novelty, significance |
| Grant proposal | Reviewers evaluating funding worthiness | Significance, feasibility, impact |

> **Always specify the audience in your prompt.**

> Speaker notes: Different audiences need different framing. The same research project should sound different in an abstract vs. a grant proposal.

---

## Slide 8: Abstract Prompt Example

> Help me draft a structured abstract (250 words max):
>
> - **Topic:** AI adoption among accounting lecturers in Nigerian universities
> - **Method:** Cross-sectional survey, 200 respondents, TAM framework
> - **Findings:** Perceived usefulness (strongest predictor), institutional support (significant), ease of use (not significant), computer self-efficacy (moderate indirect effect)
> - **Contribution:** Extends TAM to AI in developing country higher education
>
> Structure: Background (2 sentences), Purpose (1), Methods (2), Findings (3), Conclusion (2). Formal academic language.

> Speaker notes: Note how the prompt provides all the raw ingredients and asks AI to structure them. The researcher supplies the content; AI shapes the format.

---

## Slide 9: Grant Proposal Structure

> Help me outline a 5-page research grant proposal on "Digital Literacy and AI Readiness Among Accounting Educators in West African Universities."
>
> Sections with guidance on what reviewers look for:
> 1. Problem Statement — why this matters
> 2. Research Objectives — 3-4 specific objectives
> 3. Literature Review Summary — key gaps
> 4. Methodology — multi-country study approach
> 5. Expected Outcomes and Impact
> 6. Budget Justification Categories
> 7. Timeline — 18-month study

> Speaker notes: Grant proposals are competitive. AI can help with structure and phrasing, but the significance argument must come from your expertise.

---

## Slide 10: Lesson 3 — Responding to Peer Reviewers

**The response structure for each comment:**

1. **Acknowledge** the reviewer's point
2. **Explain** how you addressed it (or why you respectfully disagree)
3. **Quote** the specific changes made
4. **Reference** the page/section where changes appear

> Speaker notes: Many early-career researchers struggle with reviewer responses. AI can help with tone, structure, and completeness.

---

## Slide 11: Reviewer Response Example

**Reviewer comment:** "The methodology section lacks detail about sampling procedures and data analysis techniques."

> Help me draft a response that:
> 1. Thanks the reviewer
> 2. Addresses each concern (sampling, response rate, validity/reliability)
> 3. Describes changes I'll make
> 4. Maintains respectful, professional tone
>
> My details: Purposive sampling, 5 universities, 67% response rate (200/300), Cronbach's alpha > 0.7, CFA validation.

> Speaker notes: Walk through the response structure. Emphasize specificity — "we added a paragraph in Section 3.2" is better than "we improved the section."

---

## Slide 12: Handling Critical Reviews

**When to accept vs. push back:**

| Accept | Push Back (Respectfully) |
|--------|------------------------|
| Reviewer identifies a genuine weakness | Suggestion would fundamentally change your scope |
| Change improves the paper | Reviewer misunderstands your approach |
| Addition is feasible | Change is impractical or unjustified |

**How to push back:**
> "We appreciate the suggestion. While we agree UTAUT offers additional constructs, our use of TAM was deliberate due to [reasons]. We have added a paragraph acknowledging this as a limitation..."

> Speaker notes: Many researchers either accept everything (losing their study's focus) or reject everything (antagonizing reviewers). Help them find the balance.

---

## Slide 13: Activity — Academic Writing Exercise

**What you'll produce:**
1. A 250-word structured abstract (real or hypothetical project)
2. Response to a simulated peer review comment
3. Revised methodology text based on the review
4. Critical evaluation of all AI outputs

**Simulated reviewer comment:**
> "The methodology section lacks sufficient detail about sampling procedures and data analysis techniques."

**Time:** 45 minutes

> Speaker notes: Participants can use their own research or create a hypothetical project. The peer review response exercise is universally applicable.
