### Day 18 - LinkedIn

Three questions we get asked:

**Q: Do you replace human reviewers?**
A: No. We accelerate the process. AI provides initial review. Humans approve, override, and handle nuance. Reviewers focus on edge cases instead of routine checks.

**Q: What about specialized domains?**
A: The system handles general academic standards (methodology, structure, citations). Domain experts still validate technical accuracy. We reduce workload, not expertise.

**Q: Is author data safe?**
A: Papers are processed through secure API calls. We don't store papers on external servers. Your data stays yours.

More questions? Let's schedule a call.

### Day 19 - Facebook

Real scenario:

Conference deadline: Friday

Detailed reviews generated: 87
Human review needed: Edge cases only
Deadline: Met

This is the reality we're building. Conference management that actually scales.
