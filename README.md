# SECTION 3: SOCIAL MEDIA CONTENT - ONE MONTH CAMPAIGN

## Week 1: Problem Awareness & Introduction

### Day 1 - Facebook/LinkedIn (Introduction)

Running an academic conference is harder than it looks.

The paper submissions pile up. Reviewers disappear. Deadlines slip. Authors wait weeks for feedback that sometimes comes in two sentences.

We built something to fix that.

SAYPEACE SOLUTIONS is proud to announce our AI-Powered Conference Management System - currently live and handling the ICIA 2025 conference at Ahmadu Bello University.

More details coming this week.

### Day 2 - Twitter/X

Academic conferences in Africa face a real problem:

- Too few reviewers
- Too many papers
- Too little time

We solved it with AI.

Now a 30-page paper gets comprehensive feedback in minutes, not weeks.

Live at ICIA 2025. Built in Nigeria. For Africa and beyond.

### Day 4 - Facebook

"Why is my paper still under review?"

If you've ever organized a conference, you've received this email. Probably dozens of times.

Here's what usually happens:
- Paper submitted
- Assigned to reviewer
- Reviewer is busy
- Days pass
- Weeks pass
- Author follows up
- Admin chases reviewer
- Eventually, feedback arrives
- More rounds of revision
- Publication delayed

We automated the first review.

Our AI analyzes papers instantly, giving authors detailed, actionable feedback while human reviewers focus on edge cases and final approval.

The result? Faster reviews. Happier authors. On-time publications.

Contact us to see how it works.

---

### Day 5 - Twitter/X

"But can AI really review academic papers?"

Valid question. Here's our approach:

AI handles:
- Section-by-section analysis
- Methodology evaluation
- Citation checking
- Formatting review
- Specific corrections

Humans handle:
- Final approval
- Context and nuance
- Edge cases
- Author disputes

AI-assisted. Not AI-only.

---

### Day 6 - LinkedIn

The hidden cost of slow paper reviews:

For conferences:
- Missed publication deadlines
- Reviewer burnout
- Administrative overhead
- Reputation damage

For authors:
- Career delays
- Stalled research
- Frustration and anxiety
- Missed opportunities

For the academic ecosystem:
- Knowledge stays locked up longer
- Collaboration slows down

We built technology to accelerate this entire process. Our AI-Powered Conference Management System is live at ICIA 2025, and the results speak for themselves.

Interested in bringing this to your institution? Let's talk.

## Week 2: Deep Dive into Features

### Day 8 - Facebook

Let's talk about what our AI actually reviews in each paper:

1. ORIGINALITY & CONTRIBUTION (25%)
Is the research novel? Does it advance the field?

2. METHODOLOGY & RIGOR (25%)
Are methods sound and replicable?

3. CLARITY & ORGANIZATION (20%)
Is the paper well-structured and readable?

4. LITERATURE REVIEW (15%)
Is it comprehensive and current?

5. RESULTS & DISCUSSION (15%)
Are findings clearly presented and analyzed?

Each section gets a score and specific feedback. Authors know exactly what to fix.

This is real, structured review - not generic comments.

See it in action: [Link]

---

### Day 9 - Twitter/X (Thread)

Thread: How our AI review system works (1/5)

1/5: Author uploads paper (PDF or DOCX). System extracts full text automatically.

2/5: AI analyzes against academic standards. Checks methodology, citations, structure, clarity.

3/5: Generates review with:
- Overall score
- Section scores
- Specific corrections
- Severity ratings (Critical/Major/Minor)

4/5: Admin reviews AI output. Approves, edits, or adds notes before author sees it.

5/5: Author receives comprehensive feedback. Can ask questions via AI chat assistant.

Human oversight + AI efficiency = Better conferences.

---

### Day 10 - LinkedIn

One feature our clients love: **Intelligent Correction Tracking**

Here's the scenario:
1. AI reviews paper, identifies 15 issues
2. Author submits corrected version
3. Admin manually compares... which corrections were made?

With manual processes, this is tedious and error-prone.

Our system automates it.

When an author uploads corrections, the AI:
- Compares original vs revised text
- Maps corrections to original feedback
- Calculates compliance percentage
- Flags items still needing attention

Admins get a compliance report. Authors get clear status. Everyone saves time.

This is the kind of automation that actually matters.

---

### Day 11 - Instagram

**Image: Chat interface screenshot with overlay**

**Caption:**
Meet your author's new best friend.

Every author gets a personal AI research assistant that knows their paper, their review feedback, and their correction status.

Questions at midnight? Answered.
Confused about methodology feedback? Explained.
Need clarification on citations? Covered.

24/7 support without burning out your admin team.

This is what modern conference management looks like.

#AIAssistant #AuthorSupport #ConferenceTech

---

### Day 12 - Facebook

"What if the AI is wrong?"

We designed for this.

Every AI-generated review goes through human approval before the author sees it. Admins can:
- Edit any section
- Add their own notes
- Adjust severity ratings
- Override recommendations

If an author disagrees with AI feedback, our chat assistant is designed to handle objections. It can re-read the full paper text and provide evidence-based responses.

AI-assisted means exactly that. Humans remain in control.

Technology should support decisions, not make them unilaterally.

---

### Day 13 - Twitter/X

The economics of AI paper review:

Manual review:
- $50-100 per paper (reviewer honorarium)
- 14-30 days average turnaround
- Variable quality

AI-assisted review:
- $0 per paper (free tier API)
- Minutes, not weeks
- Consistent criteria

For a 100-paper conference, that's potentially $5,000-10,000 saved.

And time? That's even more valuable.

---

### Day 14 - LinkedIn

### Day 18 - LinkedIn

Three questions we get asked:

**Q: Do you replace human reviewers?**
A: No. We accelerate the process. AI provides initial review. Humans approve, override, and handle nuance. Reviewers focus on edge cases instead of routine checks.

**Q: What about specialized domains?**
A: The system handles general academic standards (methodology, structure, citations). Domain experts still validate technical accuracy. We reduce workload, not expertise.

**Q: Is author data safe?**
A: Papers are processed through secure API calls. We don't store papers on external servers. Your data stays yours.

More questions? Let's schedule a call.

### Day 19 - Facebook

Real scenario:

Conference deadline: Friday

Detailed reviews generated: 87
Human review needed: Edge cases only
Deadline: Met

This is the reality we're building. Conference management that actually scales.
