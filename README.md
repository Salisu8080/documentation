## Week 2: Deep Dive into Features

### Day 8 - Facebook

Let's talk about what our AI actually reviews in each paper:

1. ORIGINALITY & CONTRIBUTION (25%)
Is the research novel? Does it advance the field?

2. METHODOLOGY & RIGOR (25%)
Are methods sound and replicable?

3. CLARITY & ORGANIZATION (20%)
Is the paper well-structured and readable?

4. LITERATURE REVIEW (15%)
Is it comprehensive and current?

5. RESULTS & DISCUSSION (15%)
Are findings clearly presented and analyzed?

Each section gets a score and specific feedback. Authors know exactly what to fix.

This is real, structured review - not generic comments.

### Day 9 - Twitter/X (Thread)

Thread: How our AI review system works (1/5)

1/5: Author uploads paper (PDF or DOCX). System extracts full text automatically.

2/5: AI analyzes against academic standards. Checks methodology, citations, structure, clarity.

3/5: Generates review with:
- Overall score
- Section scores
- Specific corrections
- Severity ratings (Critical/Major/Minor)

4/5: Admin reviews AI output. Approves, edits, or adds notes before author sees it.

5/5: Author receives comprehensive feedback. Can ask questions via AI chat assistant.

Human oversight + AI efficiency = Better conferences.

---

### Day 10 - LinkedIn

One feature our clients love: **Intelligent Correction Tracking**

Here's the scenario:
1. AI reviews paper, identifies 15 issues
2. Author submits corrected version
3. Admin manually compares... which corrections were made?

With manual processes, this is tedious and error-prone.

Our system automates it.

When an author uploads corrections, the AI:
- Compares original vs revised text
- Maps corrections to original feedback
- Calculates compliance percentage
- Flags items still needing attention

Admins get a compliance report. Authors get clear status. Everyone saves time.

This is the kind of automation that actually matters.

---

### Day 11 - Instagram

**Image: Chat interface screenshot with overlay**

**Caption:**
Meet your author's new best friend.

Every author gets a personal AI research assistant that knows their paper, their review feedback, and their correction status.

Questions at midnight? Answered.
Confused about methodology feedback? Explained.
Need clarification on citations? Covered.

24/7 support without burning out your admin team.

This is what modern conference management looks like.

#AIAssistant #AuthorSupport #ConferenceTech

### Day 12 - Facebook

"What if the AI is wrong?"

We designed for this.

Every AI-generated review goes through human approval before the author sees it. Admins can:
- Edit any section
- Add their own notes
- Adjust severity ratings
- Override recommendations

If an author disagrees with AI feedback, our chat assistant is designed to handle objections. It can re-read the full paper text and provide evidence-based responses.

AI-assisted means exactly that. Humans remain in control.

Technology should support decisions, not make them unilaterally.

---

### Day 13 - Twitter/X

The economics of AI paper review:

Manual review:
- $50-100 per paper (reviewer honorarium)
- 14-30 days average turnaround
- Variable quality

AI-assisted review:
- $0 per paper (free tier API)
- Minutes, not weeks
- Consistent criteria

For a 100-paper conference, that's potentially $5,000-10,000 saved.

And time? That's even more valuable.

### Day 18 - LinkedIn

Three questions we get asked:

**Q: Do you replace human reviewers?**
A: No. We accelerate the process. AI provides initial review. Humans approve, override, and handle nuance. Reviewers focus on edge cases instead of routine checks.

**Q: What about specialized domains?**
A: The system handles general academic standards (methodology, structure, citations). Domain experts still validate technical accuracy. We reduce workload, not expertise.

**Q: Is author data safe?**
A: Papers are processed through secure API calls. We don't store papers on external servers. Your data stays yours.

More questions? Let's schedule a call.

### Day 19 - Facebook

Real scenario:

Conference deadline: Friday

Detailed reviews generated: 87
Human review needed: Edge cases only
Deadline: Met

This is the reality we're building. Conference management that actually scales.
