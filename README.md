30 days ago, we started sharing what we built.

An AI system that reviews academic papers in minutes.
A tracking system that monitors author corrections automatically.
A chat assistant that supports authors 24/7.
A conference platform that actually scales.

Not a concept. Not a pilot. A production system handling real papers for a real conference.

Thank you to everyone who engaged, asked questions, and showed interest.
