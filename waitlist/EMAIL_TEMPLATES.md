## Email 4: Value Content (Day 7)

**Trigger**: 7 days after signup

**Subject**: How [Industry] companies are using AI for customer support

**From**: [Your Name], Founder at AMINA AI

**Body**:
```
Hi [Name],

I wanted to share something interesting with you.

We recently analyzed how [Industry] businesses are using AI for customer support—and the results were surprising.

THE PROBLEM

Most [Industry] companies handle [average volume] customer inquiries per month. With an average response time of [X] minutes, this means:
• Your support team spends [Y] hours just on repetitive questions
• [Z]% of customers wait longer than they should
• Support costs are growing faster than revenue

THE SOLUTION

The top-performing companies we studied did 3 things:
1. **Automated repetitive questions** (70% of all inquiries)
   - "What are your business hours?"
   - "How do I track my order?"
   - "What's your return policy?"

2. **Offered 24/7 availability** without hiring night shifts
   - Customers in different time zones get instant responses
   - After-hours inquiries don't pile up until morning

3. **Used AI that learns from their business**
   - Trained on their specific products, policies, and FAQs
   - Gets smarter over time from real conversations

THE RESULTS

• 80% reduction in response time (hours → seconds)
• 70% of inquiries resolved without human intervention
• 40-60% increase in customer satisfaction scores
• 90% cost savings vs. hiring more agents

This is exactly what we're building with AMINA AI.

WHAT'S NEXT FOR [COMPANY NAME]?

Based on your industry and size, AMINA AI could help [Company Name]:
• Handle [volume estimate] more inquiries without hiring
• Reduce response time by [X]%
• Free up your team to focus on complex, high-value issues

Want to see how? We're opening up personalized demos for [Industry] businesses next month.

## Email 5: Case Study (Week 2)

**Subject**: How [Company] reduced support tickets by 70% with AI

**Body**:
```
Hi [Name],

I want to tell you about [Company Name], a [Industry] business that was drowning in customer support inquiries.

BEFORE AMINA AI:
• 3,000+ inquiries/month
• Average response time: 4-6 hours
• 5-person support team working overtime
• Customer satisfaction score (CSAT): 62%

THE PROBLEM:
70% of their inquiries were repetitive questions like:
- "What are your delivery times?"
- "How do I reset my password?"
- "Do you ship to [location]?"

Their support team was burning out answering the same questions over and over—while complex issues got delayed.

THE SOLUTION:
They implemented AMINA AI to handle first-line support:
• AI agent trained on their knowledge base (FAQs, policies, product docs)
• Integrated with WhatsApp, web chat, and Facebook Messenger
• Seamless handoff to human agents for complex issues
• Available 24/7, even when the office is closed

THE RESULTS (After 3 months):
✅ 70% reduction in tickets reaching human agents
✅ Response time: 4 hours → 30 seconds
✅ Support team: 5 → 2 agents (refocused on complex issues)
✅ CSAT score: 62% → 89%
✅ Monthly cost savings: ₦[amount]

WHAT THEY SAID:
"AMINA AI transformed our support. Our team is no longer overwhelmed, and customers get instant answers—even at midnight. Best investment we've made."
— [Name], [Title] at [Company]

COULD THIS WORK FOR [YOUR COMPANY]?

If [Company Name] is handling [volume estimate] inquiries/month, you could see similar results.

## Email 6: Feature Spotlight (Week 3)

**Subject**: Feature spotlight: How AMINA AI learns from your business

**Body**:
```
Hi [Name],

One question we get a lot:

"How is AMINA AI different from generic chatbots that give robotic answers?"

Great question. Here's the difference:

GENERIC CHATBOTS 🤖:
❌ Pre-programmed responses
❌ Can't answer business-specific questions
❌ Break when customers ask something unexpected
❌ Require constant manual updates

AMINA AI 🧠:
✅ Learns from YOUR knowledge base (docs, FAQs, past conversations)
✅ Understands context and asks clarifying questions
✅ Provides accurate, business-specific answers
✅ Gets smarter over time from real interactions

HOW IT WORKS:

1. **Knowledge Base Ingestion**
   - Upload your FAQs, product docs, policies (PDF, Word, web pages)
   - AMINA AI processes and indexes everything
   - Takes 5 minutes to set up

2. **Contextual Understanding**
   - Customer: "Do you ship to Lagos?"
   - AMINA AI: "Yes! We offer same-day delivery in Lagos. Delivery fee is ₦1,500 within Lekki and Ikoyi, ₦2,000 elsewhere."
   - (It knows your delivery policies, not generic answers)

3. **Smart Handoffs**
   - If AMINA AI can't confidently answer (80% threshold), it escalates to your team
   - Includes full conversation context
   - No repeated questions for the customer

4. **Continuous Learning**
   - Your team reviews flagged conversations
   - Approves accurate responses
   - AMINA AI learns from corrections

REAL EXAMPLE FROM A BETA USER:

Customer: "I ordered the blue dress last week but haven't received it yet. Order #12345."

AMINA AI:
1. Checks order status in your system (via integration)
2. Sees it's shipped and in transit
3. Responds: "Your order #12345 shipped on [date] via [courier]. Current status: In transit to [address]. Expected delivery: [date]. Tracking link: [link]. Need anything else?"

All automatic. No human intervention needed.

WHAT THIS MEANS FOR [COMPANY NAME]:

Instead of training a chatbot with rigid scripts, you just:
• Upload your existing documentation
• Let AMINA AI learn your business
• Go live in under 24 hours

Want to see it in action? We're offering personalized demos to waitlist members.

P.S. Our beta users are seeing 70-80% of inquiries resolved without human intervention. Curious if this would work for [Industry] businesses? Let's talk.

Hi [Name],

I just reviewed your priority survey for [Company Name].

Handling [Volume] inquiries/month is no joke—especially when you're dealing with [Challenge].

SPECIFIC TO [COMPANY NAME]:

Based on your volume and industry, AMINA AI could help you:
• Automate [X]% of repetitive inquiries (estimates, availability, policies)
• Reduce response time by [Y]% (hours → seconds)
• Offer 24/7 support without hiring night shift agents

## Email Best Practices

### Subject Lines

- **Use personalization**: [Name], [Company Name]
- **Create urgency**: "Last chance", "Expires in 24 hours"
- **Ask questions**: "What's your biggest support challenge?"
- **Use emojis sparingly**: 🚀 🎉 ⏰ (1 per subject line max)

### Body Copy
- **Start with "Hi [Name]"**: Personalization increases open rates
- **Hook in first line**: State benefit or ask a question
- **Use short paragraphs**: 2-3 sentences max
